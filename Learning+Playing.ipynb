It stars Paul Walker Frances OConnor Gerard Butler Billy Connolly David Thewlis and Anna Friel among others.  Jerry Goldsmith composed the original score which would have been his last before his death in 2004 but it was replaced with a new score by Brian Tyler after the first cut was reedited and Goldsmiths increasing health problems did not allow him to continue.
